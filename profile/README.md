## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The name was supposed to be LinkSync, Since that name was already taken while building i decided to go with this.

### Motivation
While i browse through LinkedIn,Whatsapp or X i get couple of good url's. If i'm browsing through my mobile then i would send it to you conversation for referring it at a later point.By the year end i had some 100 
links scattered in my mobile, laptop browser. i wanted all of this to managed conveniently and efficiently without redundancy so i decided to build LynkSync.

### What product will do?
A website to manage URL and categories.
- You can use browser to bookmark url on desktop/laptop browser then this would sync to cloud https://github.com/lynksync/lynksync.
- On mobile you can send URL to bot which will autocategorise.
- By default we've a set of categories you can customise it through portal.
Apart from these in future we will have AI features for quick read through related categories, create shareable notes etc

### How to contribute
- Will update soon
